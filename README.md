<a href="http://ce.sharif.edu/programs-and-courses/">CE courseware</a> does not inform students when there is any update.
but some courses have a lot of updates each day(see courses taught by <a href="http://sharif.edu/~abtahi/">instructor abtahi</a> for example)
<br/>
This python script checks whethere there is any update or not, if so, sends an email and informs the updates!
#Usage
1. set course_url with proper value
2. in line 59, set your email and password.
3. finally deploy it on a server!


have fun!
